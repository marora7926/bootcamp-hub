## User Story

```

AS AN Bootcamp student with access to Bootcamp hub Website
I WANT to access a useful website that meets criteria for different skills, where I can access updated date, time and weather report and apply for upcoming job ventures.
 In addition, supplying me with useful resources and providing me with quick link access to them if needed. As well as allowing me to develop a personal to-do-list in order to keep on track and on top of my work and opportunity to access other fun activities such as games and/or cheats I find to be beneficial to my learning.
SO I CAN stay organised with my work, progressing me further with my course and helping me stay on track to becoming successful.
