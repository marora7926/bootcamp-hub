## User Story

```
AS A coding BOOTCAMP STUDENT
I WANT to be able to add my own links in the useful resources
So THAT I can easily access them when needed.

I WANT to have set reminders of up coming tasks and scheduled activities
So THAT I'm reminded and don't miss out on anything important.

I WANT the links to the jobs to lead me to the job application
So THAT I can land on a page where I'm able to easily apply for the jobs.

```
